title:  "Nikolai Lugansky's uncrossed hands in Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor"
---

In [this video of Nikolai Lugansky playing Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C#
Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1D-EQNTZWI) it's clear at 0:17 that his
right hand is playing the G# notated for the left hand in the second beat of
measure 2.  I don't think he totally uncrosses the hands but there's a lot less
hand acrobatics going on than in e.g. [this Evgeny Kissin
performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCm9O2KNEX4).

I'm making an attempt at this piece right now and it was interesting to see
that effective performance doesn't require 100% dedication to playing hand
twister.
