title:  "The Beatles - In My Life - keyboard solo"
---

I haven't seen George Martin's keyboard solo in The Beatles' "In My Life"
transcribed correctly, so I loaded up
[Transcribe!](https://www.seventhstring.com/) and
[MuseScore](https://musescore.org) and wrote it out.

Suggested fingerings are included.
