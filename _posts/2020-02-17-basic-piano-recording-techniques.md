title:  "Basic piano recording techniques"

## Hello!

So you want to record your piano performances? Great!

Recording is so rewarding but it's also unforgiving and frustrating.  It lets
you send songs to your friends, your family, and the entire internet, and it
lets you enter the world of recorded music sales.  It also lets you preserve
all of your performance mistakes in high fidelity, forever, for all to hear.

Nervous yet?

Your first few recordings will be kind of atrocious.  They'll finally let you
hear what your piano teacher has been telling you (maybe for years) but that
you've never really internalized because it's very hard to listen critically
while playing at your limit.  Use that new-found ability to concentrate solely
on listening, figure out what you're doing wrong, and get good!

Don't get hung up on expecting perfection though; a perfect recording is
rarely made in one take.  Professional recordings are collages consisting of multiple
takes, multiple overdubs, and even _pieces of notes_.  Think extreme Photoshop
but for audio.  Automated tools exist for both tempo and pitch correction --
take a look at [Antares Auto-Tune](https://www.antarestech.com/) or [Logic Pro's
Flex Time](https://help.apple.com/logicpro/mac/10.4/#/lgcp15968647).

Lower your standards to start and get some recordings done.  Remember, a final
draft is still a draft; it's just that someone decided it wasn't worthwhile to
keep making changes.

Then work on your skills and raise your standards over time.

Good luck!

## A map

This document will introduce several basic ways to record digital and acoustic
pianos.

This document is a map and is not an exhaustive step-by-step guide.  If
knowledge can be assumed (e.g. how to play the piano or how to click the mouse
on the computer) I've omitted it.  If information is well documented somewhere
else (e.g. in a user manual), I'll direct you to that place.  Instead, I'll
provide a way to connect the dots between those types of information.

## Terms

### Audio vs. MIDI

A digital audio file contains the sounds that you hear.

A MIDI file contains no sounds of its own and instead contains commands that
instruct an instrument how it should play sounds (note on, note off, pedal
down, pedal up, etc.).

As MIDI is a huge world unto itself and doesn't allow one-step recording of the
sound of a performance, I'll focus on digital audio here.

### Types of digital audio files

Digital audio files that you download or stream are compressed to save
bandwidth and storage space.  Some degradation in quality occurs with typical
"lossy" compression techniques such as MP3 or AAC.  As a result, some pianos
will record uncompressed WAV files with no associated degradation.  Sharing WAV
files directly might annoy your friends when they receive a 150 megabyte email
attachment.  Compress WAV files using audio software.
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a great place to start -- it's
free, open source, and well supported.

Compressing a file with Audacity is easy:

1. Open the WAV file in Audacity.
1. From the menu, File > Export > Export as MP3
1. Name your file and save -- default settings are fine.

### DAW

DAW is short for [Digital Audio
Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation), most
commonly a software program used to record and edit audio.

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) can work in a pinch.  More
sophisticated programs are more expensive and have a learning curve but are
worthwhile for more serious recording.

On Apple computers, [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) has a
shallow learning curve and a direct upgrade path to [Logic
Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) for those who outgrow its significant
(but still limited) capabilities.

Many audio interfaces bundle intro (limited but reasonably powerful) versions
of DAW software such as [Ableton Live
Lite](https://www.ableton.com/en/products/live-lite/) or [Pro Tools
First](https://my.avid.com/get/pro-tools-first).

### Audio interface

An external audio interface allows you to receive audio from multiple sources
-- for example, line-outs from a digital piano or microphones positioned
around an acoustic piano.

If you're recording a digital piano via USB, you may not need one.

## Recording a digital piano

Depending on your gear, several methods may be available for recording a
digital piano.

* Record directly from the piano to a USB flash drive
* Record digital audio from the piano via USB
* Record analog audio from the piano via line outputs

### USB audio capabilities of popular digital pianos

The following tables show the USB audio capabilities of a few popular stage
pianos plus [portable pianos recommended in the Reddit /r/piano
FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/wiki/faq#wiki_specific_suggestions).

### Quick-and-dirty flash drive recording

Recording directly to a USB flash drive offers the least flexibility but it
also requires the least amount of gear.  If you don't want to fuss with a
computer or don't want to buy new gear, it's a decent way to proceed.

**You'll need**:
* A digital piano that supports recording audio to a flash drive
* The piano's user manual
* A USB flash drive
* A computer 

**Do the following**:

1. Plug a flash drive into the digital piano's host USB port and follow the
instructions in your user manual.
1. Once you're done recording, remove the flash drive from your piano, insert
   it into your computer, and listen to the file to make sure it's good.
1. If you've recorded a WAV file, compress it as described in [Types of digital
   audio files](#types-of-digital-audio-files), above.
1. Then share it with as big of a world as you'd like.

### Record digital audio via USB

A select few digital pianos can act as digital audio interfaces, meaning that
they output digital audio over USB when connected to a computer.  This feature
is incredibly convenient but unfortunately isn't very common.  In the list
above, only the Roland RD-2000 and Yamaha CP88 stage pianos, as well as the
Yamaha P-125 portable piano support it.

**You'll need**:
* A digital piano that supports USB audio
* A USB A-to-B cable
* A computer
* Audio recording software, e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to
  start

**Do the following**:
1. Use the USB A-to-B cable to connect the piano to the computer.
1. Open Audacity and select the piano as your input source.
1. Press the microphone button to start monitoring -- listening to the input
   but not recording it.
1. Play a few keys and check that the audio meter is showing activity.
1. Press record.
1. Perform!
1. Export the audio as MP3.

### Record analog audio via line-outs, basic

If your computer has a stereo line input, all you'll need to get started is an
adapter cable allowing you to connect your piano's line output to your
computer's line input.

If your computer has a built-in line input, it'll likely be a 1/8" (3.5mm)
stereo jack.

If your piano has a 1/8" stereo line output jack, you'll need a standard
1/8" to 1/8" TRS cable.  The [Hosa CMM-110 Stereo Interconnect
Cable](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/CMM110--hosa-cmm-110-3.5mm-trs-male-to-3.5mm-trs-male-cable-10-foot)
is an inexpensive example.

If your piano has 1/4" Left and Right line output jacks, you'll need a Y cable
with a 1/8" TRS plug on one end and two 1/4" TS plugs on the other.  The [Hosa
CMP-159 Stereo Breakout Cable](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/CMP159--hosa-cmp-159-stereo-breakout-3.5mm-trs-to-dual-1-4-inch-ts-10-foot)
is an inexpensive example.

**You'll need**:
* A digital piano with line ouputs
* A computer with line inputs
* An adapter cable
* Audio recording software, e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to
  start

**Do the following**:
1. Use the adapter cable to connect the piano to the computer.
1. Open Audacity and select the computer's built-in line input as your input
   source.
1. Press the microphone button to start monitoring -- listening to the input
   but not recording it.
1. Play a few keys and check that the audio meter is showing activity.  Adjust
   the input level until your very loudest playing doesn't hit the maximum
   level.
1. Press record.
1. Perform!
1. Export the audio as MP3.

### Record analog audio via line-outs, better

Some computers don't have line inputs.  Even if yours does, it may not provide
a very high quality signal or you may have to choose between connecting
headphones and connecting your piano.

In these situations, you'll want to buy an external audio interface with at
least two channels.  If you don't know what to buy, get a [Focusrite Scarlett
2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2) for
$160 and be done with it.  If you must, you can go cheaper with a [Behringer
U-Phoria UM2](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Interfaces/UM2/p/P0AVV)
for $50.  If you're on Windows, it's nice that the Scarlett comes bundled with
DAW software so you can move up from Audacity without spending more money.  The
Behringer does not.

These external audio interfaces receive line-level audio via 1/4" mono jacks.
If your piano has 1/4" Left and Right line output jacks, you'll need two
standard 1/4" TS instrument cables.  The [Pro Co
EGSS-10](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/QTR10--pro-co-eg-10-excellines-instrument-cable-10-foot-straight-straight)
is an inexpensive example.

**You'll need**:
* A digital piano with line ouputs
* A computer
* An external audio interface
* Cables
* Audio recording software, e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to
  start

**Do the following**:
1. Connect the computer, external interface, and piano.
1. Open Audacity and select the external interface as your input source.
1. Press the microphone button to start monitoring -- listening to the input
   but not recording it.
1. Play a few keys and check that the audio meter is showing activity.  Adjust
   the input level until your very loudest playing doesn't hit the maximum
   level.  Be sure to adjust both left and right channels equally.
1. Press record.
1. Perform!
1. Export the audio as MP3.

## Recording an acoustic piano

Recording an acoustic piano is considerably more involved than recording a
digital piano.  Table stakes include buying an external audio interface, a pair
of microphones, and one or more high quality microphone stands.

We'll discuss stereo recording techniques.

**WARNING**: DO NOT SKIMP on microphone stands.  I've had a cheap microphone
stand fall over and go through the front of a guitar.  Do you want to pay top
dollar to have your piano fixed, the one that might have cost you tens of
thousands of dollars to buy? Spend the money on good stands with wide, heavy
bases and counterweighted booms and think of them as an insurance policy.


### Recommended equipment

* **External audio interface**.  You'll need one with at least two microphone
  preamps.
  * [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2) ($160)
* **Microphones**. Choose the pair of small diaphragm condensers that matches your
  budget. Note that the $200 Røde M5s are fantastic.
  * Røde [M5 matched pair](http://www.rode.com/microphones/m5) ($200)
  * sE [sE7 matched pair](https://www.seelectronics.com/se7-mic) ($200)
  * Røde [NT5 matched pair](http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt5) ($430) 
  * If you want to spend more than $430 on a pair of microphones, consider if
  your space matches the quality of microphones you'd like to buy.  The $200
  Røde M5s are already accurate enough to faithfully capture the sound of your
  forced air heating and cooling, footsteps in adjacent rooms, and car horns
  outside.  Consider paying for studio time instead.
* **Microphone cables**.  Buy decent mic cables with Neutrik or Rean
  connectors.  The cheap ones have crappy connectors that don't seat well and
  you'll have to buy yet more cables to replace them.  All of these are fine:
  * 2x [Pro Co EXM-10 Excellines Microphone Cable - 10'](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/XLR10--pro-co-exm-10-excellines-microphone-cable-10-foot) ($22)
  * 2x [Mogami CorePlus Microphone Cable - 10'](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MCPXLR10--mogami-coreplus-microphone-cable-10-foot-xlr-xlr) ($30)
  * 2x [Mogami Gold Studio Microphone Cable 10'](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/GoldStu10--mogami-gold-studio-microphone-cable-10-foot-xlr-xlr) ($50)
* **Small folding table**. Get a folding snack table for next to the piano.
  It's a great place to put your computer and external audio interface.
  * [Bed Bath and Beyond has tons of choices](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/s/folding-snack-tables), for example.

#### For grand pianos

For grand pianos we'll be using a coincident stereo microphone placement,
meaning that you'll only need one mic stand.

* **Mic stand that won't fall over**.  Choose one of these or similar.
  * [On Stage SB96+](https://on-stage.com/products/view/10760) studio boom stand ($115)
  * [On Stage SB9600](https://on-stage.com/products/view/12911) tripod studio boom stand ($140)
* **Stereo microphone mount**. Choose one of these or similar.
  * [On Stage MY500](https://on-stage.com/products/view/12645) ($11)
  * [Rode Stereo Bar](http://www.rode.com/accessories/sb20) ($50)

#### For upright pianos

For upright pianos we'll be using a spaced stereo microphone placement, meaning
that you'll need two mic stands but won't need a stereo mount.

* **Mic stands that won't fall over**.  Buy two.
  * 2x [On Stage SB96+](https://on-stage.com/products/view/10760) studio boom stand ($115)
  * 2x [On Stage SB9600](https://on-stage.com/products/view/12911) tripod studio boom stand ($140)


### Reading

* [Shure's Microphone Techniques for Recording](https://www.shure.com/damfiles/default/global/documents/publications/en/performance-production/microphone_techniques_for_recording_english.pdf-bb0469316afdb6118691d2f3f5e3ff01.pdf) is essential reading.  Before you try any special mic placements, try the positions that it recommends.
* The [Mic
It!](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9780415823777/default.php) book
($35) is a good supplement and goes over principles and techniques in a lot
more detail than Shure's guide.
* Røde's [Stereo Microphone
Techniques](http://www.rode.com/blog/all/stereotechniques) post is a nice
supplement and includes videos of several stereo placements.

### Recording a grand piano

We'll be using a coincident X-Y stereo placement straight out of Shure's guide
-- it's grand piano placement 1.

Opening the lid is essential!

**You'll need**:
* Your acoustic piano
* A computer
* All the equipment listed above
* Audio recording software, e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to
  start

**Do the following**:
1. Open the piano's lid all the way or remove it entirely.
1. Set up your computer, external audio interface, mics, stereo bar, and boom stand.
1. Use grand piano placement 1 from [Shure's Microphone Techniques for
   Recording](https://www.shure.com/damfiles/default/global/documents/publications/en/performance-production/microphone_techniques_for_recording_english.pdf-bb0469316afdb6118691d2f3f5e3ff01.pdf) (page 11)
   with a 135-degree X-Y coincident stereo placement (page 22).  Make sure the
   mic _pointing_ at the bass strings connects to channel 1 of your external audio interface
   and the mic _pointing_ at the treble strings connects to channel 2.
1. Open Audacity and select the external interface (channels 1 and 2) as your
   input source.
1. Press the microphone button to start monitoring -- listening to the input
   but not recording it.
1. Play a few keys and check that the audio meter is showing activity.  Adjust
   the input level until your very loudest playing doesn't hit the maximum
   level.  Be sure to adjust both left and right channels equally.
1. Press record.
1. Perform!
1. Export the audio as MP3.

### Recording an upright piano

We'll be using a spaced stereo placement straight out of Shure's guide --
upright piano placements 1 and 2.  It's tough to avoid hammer attack with easy
upright placements, especially if your piano is up against a wall.

Opening the lid is essential!  Lots of people like putting all kinds of stuff
on top of their uprights.  That's great, but clear it off for the purposes of
recording.

**You'll need**:
* Your acoustic piano
* A computer
* All the equipment listed above
* Audio recording software, e.g. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to
  start

**Do the following**:
1. Open the piano's lid all the way or remove it entirely.
1. Set up your computer, external audio interface, mics, stereo bar, and boom stand.
1. Set one stand up to the left of the piano and the other to the right.
1. Set up the left stand with upright piano placement 2 from [Shure's Microphone Techniques for
   Recording](https://www.shure.com/damfiles/default/global/documents/publications/en/performance-production/microphone_techniques_for_recording_english.pdf-bb0469316afdb6118691d2f3f5e3ff01.pdf)
   (page 12).  Make sure to hook this mic up to channel 1 of your external
   audio interface.
1. Set up the right stand with upright piano placement 1 from [Shure's Microphone Techniques for
   Recording](https://www.shure.com/damfiles/default/global/documents/publications/en/performance-production/microphone_techniques_for_recording_english.pdf-bb0469316afdb6118691d2f3f5e3ff01.pdf)
   (page 12).  Make sure to hook this mic up to channel 2 of your external
   audio interface.
1. Open Audacity and select the external interface (channels 1 and 2) as your
   input source.
1. Press the microphone button to start monitoring -- listening to the input
   but not recording it.
1. Play a few keys and check that the audio meter is showing activity.  Adjust
   the input level until your very loudest playing doesn't hit the maximum
   level.  Be sure to adjust both left and right channels equally.
1. Press record.
1. Perform!
1. Export the audio as MP3.

## Where do you go from here?

Some ideas to start.

* Post a track on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/) for others to hear.
* Pick a DAW and learn how to use it.
* Get some headphones and record to a [click
  track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_track).  Learn both parts of a
  piece for two pianos / four hands and
  [overdub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdubbing) the parts.
* Record yourself playing études or exercises -- even scales -- and get them
  perfect.  Listen for that thumb thud or that little space where you're
  playing not-quite-legato and get rid of it.
* On a digital piano, record each part with a different piano sound.
* On an acoustic piano, try different mic placements and see which one you like the
  best.  Once you find your favorite, tweak it and see if you can make it even
  better.
* Record different instruments or your voice.
